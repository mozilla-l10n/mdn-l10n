# mdn-l10n

This project contains the [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext)
location files for [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org). These are the
UI and user-facing strings for:

* [Kuma](https://github.com/mdn/kuma), the engine of MDN

To update translations, please use
[Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/projects/mdn/). Pontoon will update
this repository with your changes. They will be applied to the website on
the next production push, which happens once or twice a week on an
irregular schedule.

The source strings are updated by the MDN development team. See the
[Kuma documentation on Localization](https://kuma.readthedocs.io/en/latest/localization.html)
for more information.
